# Minimal Portfolio

This repo contains an easy-to-customize personal minimal portfolio template that was created with pure CSS and HTML5. It is lightweight and fully responsive. The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go. Alternatively, you can edit styles, colours, and scripts fairly easily. The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content.
